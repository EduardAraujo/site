**Important** : deploying to the Codio production target type will require a paid plan. See [Paid Subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions/).

Here are some things to note about the Codio target

- Ideal for static web sites and content
- Great for web application front-ends
- There is no admin or command line access to the servers

## Codio targets and URL's
When you create a Codio target type, the root URL of your deployed app will be

- `http://username.codio.io/projectname`

Once you have successfully deployed, the actual URL is shown in the popup dialog that appears when you click the Deploy link in the top bar.
