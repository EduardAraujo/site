There are three ways to deploy projects.



##Tools->Deployment->Deploy menu
This let's you deploy to any of your deployment targets you created in [Manage Targets](/docs/ide/tools/deployment/create). You are shown a log if any errors occur.

##Right Click in the file tree
You can deploy an individual file or folder by right-clicking in the file tree.


##Command Line
You can use the command line directly but you can also add your custom deployment actions by [modifying the Run Menu](/docs/boxes/overview/run).
