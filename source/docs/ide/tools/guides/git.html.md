Guides is managed on regular files in your project (more [technical info here](/docs/guides/technical)). For this reason, Git will work perfectly with your Guides content.

Because you can spend a lot of time editing your work and potentially make mistakes, we recommend that you use Git to version your Guides.

In this way, should you have any disasters, you can easily recover earlier versions.

Git is preinstalled on Codio and your workspace is already initialized, so it's really a no-brainer.
