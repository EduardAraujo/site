**BETA:** Guides is currently in Beta.

**IMPORTANT** : there is no collaboration support for editing Guides and you MUST AVOID 2 PEOPLE TRYING TO EDIT THE GUIDE SIMULTANEOUSLY.

Codio Guides is a fully integrated content authoring tool that allows you to write rich tutorial type content using pure markdown.
