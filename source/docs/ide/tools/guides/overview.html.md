A Codio project can have a single Guide. Within that Guide you can have as many sections as you like.

To create a new Guide, or to edit an existing one, go to the 'Tools->Edit Guide' menu option.

You may find it helpful to split Codio into 2 panes using the 'View->Panels' or 'View->Layouts' menu options. This way you can edit your Guides in one pane while working on code in the other.

Having selected 'Edit Guides' you will see your Guides window appear.

##Editor Functions
Within the editor is a toolbar which gives you access to the key functions.

- **Files** allows you to specify a) which files you want to automatically open when the current section is displayed and b) which lines (if any) you wish to highlight within each file
- **Editable** specifies whether the files you are opening up with the **Files** option can be edited at that moment by the viewer when Guides is in Play mode
- **Layouts** allows you to specify the panel layout you want to choose for this section
- **Hamburger Icon** can be pressed to show or hide the Setion List
- **Section List** lists the sections in your Guide. You can add new ones and re-order the list by dragging
