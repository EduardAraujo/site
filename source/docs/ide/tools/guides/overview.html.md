A Codio project can have a single Guide. Within that Guide you can have as many sections as you like.

To create a new Guide, or to edit an existing one, go to the 'Tools->Edit Guide' menu option.

You may find it helpful to split Codio into 2 panes using the 'View->Panels' or 'View->Layouts' menu options. This way you can edit your Guides in one pane while working on code in the other.

Having selected 'Edit Guides' you will see your Guides window appear.
