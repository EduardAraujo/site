One really useful thing you can do is to be writing your markdown and at the same time see the output being rendered in Play mode, the way a student will see it.

The simplest way to handle things is to run Play mode from the 'Tools->Guides' menu or 'View->Play Guide' menu.

This usually creates multiple panels for you according to the 'Layouts' setting if the first section in your Guide. This is often likely to be 2 columns.

Next, click on the panel where you want to open the Guide editor (probably the left panel) then open the Guide in Edit mode from the 'Tools->Guides' menu. 

You should now have something like the screenshot below. As you enter your Markdown content in the Guide editor, you will see the Play window updated simultaneously.

You can also manage your own custom panel configuration at any time as [explained here](/docs/ide/panels/).
