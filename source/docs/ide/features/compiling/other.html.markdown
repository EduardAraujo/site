It is pretty easy for us to add support for other file types (HAML, Typescript etc.). We have decided to start with a standard base set of file types but we're ready to add more by popular demand.

So please tweet [@codiohq](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&text=Hey @CodioHQ, add language support for [****]) and if there's enough demand, we'll add them in.
