You can format your code by pressing the keyboard shortcut as defined in the [User Preferences](/docs/settings-prefs/codio-prefs). By default, it is 

- key_format_code = Cmd+Shift+B (for a Mac)
- key_format_code = Ctrl+Shift+B (for anything else)

It will indent your code correctly and manage spaces and other cool things.

For example, if you start our with this

	if ('this_is'==/an_example/){of_beautifer();}else{var a=b?(c%d):e[f];}

Then after beautifying, you will end up with this

	if ('this_is' == /an_example/) {
	    of_beautifer();
	} else {
	    var a = b ? (c % d) : e[f];

##Settings
If you look within the [code-beautifier] section of the Codio Preferences, you will see the various beautification settings available. 

Don't forget, you can force these at the [Project level preferences](/docs/settings-prefs/project-prefs) if you want to have consistently beautified code regardless of who edits your code.
