You can fork any 3rd party public project into your account. If you are looking at a forked project, then it will look like this.

If you are signed into Codio, forking a project will create the fork in your account.

If the project owner has allowed box cloning you will also be able to clone the box as well as the project. See [Cloning Boxes](/docs/boxes/clone).
