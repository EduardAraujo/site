You have full control over the keyboard shortcuts for code editing. You should refer to the [Codio Preferences](/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs) section to read more about this.

Codio has its own complete set of defaults, all of which can be overriden. You can use Vim or Emacs key bindings by modifying the `keymap` preference setting. If you do not use `keymap=default`, you cannot override keyboard shortcuts.

The sections that contain productivity specific actions and shortcuts are `[Editor]` and `[Emmet]`.
