You will have seen that we have plenty of Box Parts already available (enter `parts search` from the command line). However, we are committed to adding new ones for you.

To request a new Box Parts, [create a new issue here](https://github.com/codio/boxparts/issues?page=1&state=open) and we'll get it dealt with as soon as we can.
