Each Codio Project gets its own dedicated Ubuntu Server (Box). This chapter contains important information on accessing your box, how to administer it and how to install software dependencies.

Details of your project Box can be found by going to `Project>Box Info` where information of your project URL(s) and [SSH External Access](/docs/boxes/access/) can be viewed.
