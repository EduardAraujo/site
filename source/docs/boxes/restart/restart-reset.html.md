Codio offers the ability to restart and to reset your project's Box. You can find both options in the 'Project' menu.

##Restart
This operation effectively reboots the Box. This should take no more than a second or two and is non-destructive.


##Reset 
This operation is fairly destructive and should be used with caution. It resets the Box to its fresh state but leaves your code files untouched. It does the following

- any new folders or files that have been created will be deleted
- any files outside of the `~/workspace` folder will be reset to their default state
- everything in the `~/workspace` folder is untouched
- a Box reset

After a Reset, you will need to reinstall components (npm modules, ruby gems etc.) and other modifications you may have made.
