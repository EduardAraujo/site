Git, Mercurial and SVN are all preinstalled, so you can [open up a Terminal window](/docs/boxes/terminal) to access them from the command line.

You can also configure your `.codio` file so common commands are accessible from the 'Run' menu in the Codio IDE. [Refer to the Boxes documentation](/docs/boxes/run) on how to do this.

##A few Git helpers
We have added a few Git helpers to the 'Tools->Git' menu. These are fairly limited at the moment but we plan to extend this menu to make life a little easier. Feel free to email support@codio.com or go to the [Codio Forum](http://forum.codio.com) to add requests for more Git sugar.
