To see your Guide running, you need to *Play* it. This is done from the 'Tools->Guides Play' menu option.

At this point

- the panel layout is set up automatically according to the layout specified in the first Guide section
- the first section will be displayed
- Section List is shown.

To hide or show the Section List, the Student presses the 'Hamburger' icon.

Everything should be completely self-explanatory.
