There is generally no need to save your files as content is saved automatically. If you make mistakes, then use the regular undo (`Ctrl+Z`).

If you wish to manually save, you can enable Manual Save from your [Project Settings](/docs/settings-prefs/project-settings/) and manually save the current file using `Ctrl+S` or save all open files using `Ctlr+Shift+S`.

You can customise these shortcuts if you want to use different key combinations at either the Project level or User level, see [Preferences & Settings](/docs/settings-prefs/)

Version Control is the best possible way of managing restores and this is comprehensively supported thanks to our [Git integration](/docs/git).
