Creating a new project or importing one is really easy. All you do is click on the Create Project button on the Dashboard as shown below.

You will then be shown a dialog that lets you choose the various ways to create or import a project.

##Back-End Development
If you're doing any back-end coding, please refer to the [Boxes section](/docs/boxes) for details on installing and running server side components.

##Template Option
We offer a few basic starting points with this option. Select from the Create Project dropdown list, which offers the following options

- creating a blank HTML5 Boilerplate project
- creating an empty project
- creating a PHP project
- creating a Mobile project
- creating a project from a template


##Git, Mercurial or ZIP
Additionally, you can import an existing project from a [Git repo](/docs/git-viewing), Mercurial or a ZIP file.

##FTP/SFTP
If you've got some code on a remote server and you want to import it into Codio, then you specify the server details and the project will be imported. Codio will also automatically create a [deployment profile](/docs/deployment) for you so you can deploy back to it once you start editing.

##Templates
Until we have completed the integration of Yo into Codio (will be available in 2013), we offer a template system. You will find the Template option in the dropdown list next to the Create Project radio button.

As soon as you select it, it will take you to a new page where all the templates are listed. You can click on a template project to view it in the IDE. If you want to use it, you select `Project > Fork` and it will create a fork in your account.

Most of the template projects have been generated using Yo.
