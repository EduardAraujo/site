The teacher can inspect the status of students' progress by selecting a class and then a module within that class. You then will see the list of students who were assigned that module.

To take a look at the code of any individual student, just click the right most icon. The student's project will open up in a new browser tab and you are able to review their code and also make modifications if you require.

The above screenshot shows how four students have accessed the assignment and two, Hulk and Thor, have completed it.
