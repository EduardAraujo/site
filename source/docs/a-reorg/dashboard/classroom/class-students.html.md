Each class needs to have students. Once you have selected a class, click on the Student menu item as shown below to bring up the list of students.

A newly created class will not yet have any students, so you should add some from this screen. You can enter the Codio user name or a part of their full name within the Add Student search field. 

You can remove students by pressing the 'X' next to any existing students.
