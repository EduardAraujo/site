Having created a class, you will want to assign a course to that class.

A course can be assigned to a class by the class owner and those with administration permissions granted by the owner.

Select your class and then press the 'Edit' button. This will bring up the class properties. At the bottom of this screen you will see a list of courses. You should select the course to assign to your class. The selected course will be highlighted as shown below
