A team is simply a collection of Codio users. You can create any number of teams and then add users to those teams.

Currently, there is not too much you can do with teams. We will very soon be adding more advanced permissioning so that you can assign permissions to teams for the ability to manage actions within projects and on boxes.

The number of members in each team is displayed in the team box.

##Add
Press the Create Team button to add your new team. Once created, the number of team members is shown in the team button.

##Edit
You can rename a team or edit its description by clicking on the team and then selecting the Edit button in the top of the screen.

##Delete
You can delete a team by pressing the 'X' to the right of the team name.
