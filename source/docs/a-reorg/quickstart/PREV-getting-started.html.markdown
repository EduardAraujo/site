This explains the key things you should know in order to get the most out of the Codio IDE in as short a time as possible.

##1. Signup
Signing up is effortless and gives you access to the complete set of features. Any public projects you create are (and will always be) free.

Signup from the signup link at the top of the page at [Codio.com](http://codio.com) or by going to [http://codio.com/p/signup](http://codio.com/p/signup).

You can sign in with Codio, GitHub or BitBucket. If you sign in with GitHub or BitBucket, your account will be associated with that account from that point on. 

You can also associate your account with a GitHub or BitBucket account from the Codio->Account menu item.


##2. Create a Project
Once you have signed in, you can [create a new project](/docs/console/creating) by clicking on the Create Project link in the Dashboard. 

There are several ways to start off

- Create a blank project (HTML Boilerplate, PHP Basic or completely empty)
- Import from a ZIP file
- Import from FTP/SFTP
- Import from Git/Mercurial


All of these are full described [here](/docs/console/creating).

##3. You're in the IDE
Once you're in the IDE, which you will be automatically after creating a project or opening an existing one, you're ready to start coding.

The most important thing is for you to be aware of the features that are available so you can take advantage of them when you need them. Check out the features page that list and demonstrate many of Codio's key features

- [Videos of Codio's key features](/features)

##4. Preinstalled Languages
Codio has the following languages and useful dev tools preinstalled

- Node (including nvm)
- Ruby (including rbenv)
- Python (2.7.3)
- Git, Mercurial & SVN

But you can also install many other languages, database, components and frameworks extremely easily using [Codio Box Parts](/docs/boxes/box-parts).

##5. Tutorials & How To's
We have an ever growing range of [Tutorials and How To's](/docs/specifics) that are well worth checking out. 

They cover installation instructions for things like PHP, Wordpress, Drupal Joomla. You will also find Node and Grunt tutorials and more.


##5. A bit about 'Boxes'
Whenever you create a project, you automatically get a back-end server - we call it a 'Box'.

You can access your Box from 'Tools->Terminal'. You can also configure your own terminal commands from the [Run menu](/docs/boxes/run). 

- [General Box documentation](/docs/boxes).
- [Box Feature Videos](/features)

##6. Firewalls
If you are behind a firewall then the following information might be helpful

- Enable `*.codio.com`, `*.codio.io` and `*.intercom.io` on your firewall
- Codio uses Port 80 (http) and Port 443 (https)
- You can configure your boxes to use special ports. To get around port blocking on your firewall, please refer to [this section](/docs/boxes/ext-access)


##7. User Policies

- If your organisation manages users access rights through policies (commonly experienced in Educational Establishments) and you enable [Deep Packet Inspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection), you may need to also update the rules to allow access to `*.codio.com`, `*.codio.io` and `*.intercom.io`
