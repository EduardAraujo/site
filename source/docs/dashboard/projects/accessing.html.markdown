To view a project in the IDE, simply click on one of your projects.

You can order your project list by Name/Visibility/Owner/Last Opened and whether the project is [clonable](/docs/boxes/overview/clone)

You can also search for a project by typing into the Search field and the file list will dynamically filter for you as you type.
