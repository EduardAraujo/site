If you can't find an existing Stack that is ready to use, then you can configure Stack components within a Codio project and then add it to your Stack library.

To do this you will first need to

- Either create a new project and [install the software components](/docs/boxes/installsw) into it.
- Or use an existing project. Once you have the [software components correctly configured](/docs/boxes/installsw), you are ready to add that project's Stack to the Stack library.

To create your new Stack, click the 'Create Stack' button at the top right of the Stack listing screen.

##Stack Blueprint
The first thing you will need to specify is the Codio project that you want to use for your Stack blueprint. Click the elipsis to locate your project that you want to take the Stack from.

##Details, Image and Tags
Next, add a short name for your Stack and a longer description. You can also add a more detailed overview of your Stack by selecting the "add a long description" link. You write this long description is written in Markdown and it can contain as much information about your Stack as you like.

You can also add an image to make your Stacks listing more instantly recognizable. This should be a square image, which will be reduced in size and will appear in a circle as shown below.

You can also add tags to your Stack. The tags should be component names ideally. There is an autocomplete function that will help you to use already defined tags to avoid tag duplication and ensure maximum efficiency when searching.

##Visibility
By default, Stacks that you create can be seen by other people in the **Popular** and **All** Stacks listings. If you want to keep your Stack private to you or your Organization, you can select the Private option. Private Stacks require a paid subscription.

##Owner
By default, you will be the owner of this Stack and only you can edit it and [create new versions](/docs/stacks/update) of the Stack. If you want to allow others to administer your Stack, you can assign it to another user or to an Organization.
