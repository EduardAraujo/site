Only course owners or those with administration permissions for the course may modify modules.

Let's say you have created a module within a course and then you decide you want to update the Codio project associated with that module. 

You can edit the source Codio project by opening it from your normal Codio projects list. Alternatively, if you are viewing the course in the course list, you can open it by clicking on the edit (pencil) icon and then press the Edit button within the Codio tab.

##Snapshots
It is important to note that Codio modules are based on project snapshots and do not reference the source Codio project. The reason for this is that we do not want assigned course modules to change by accident if the source were to be updated.

##Updating a Course Module
If you do update the source project and need to update the course module associated with that project, then you simply click the refresh button for the relevant module as shown below.

You should be aware that if you have created a [class](/docs/education/teachers/classes) and assigned that module to that class then any modifications you make to the source project will not be seen by the class.
