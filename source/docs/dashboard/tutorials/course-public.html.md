Codio is proud to have a major Education initiative underway that promotes the teaching of coding globally with open source content at its heart.

When you create a course in Codio, it can be kept private to yourself or to your organization, if you have a paid subscription. However, if you are happy to have your course public then it becomes available for anyone else in the world to use. Public courses can be freely used, copied and modified.

To enable your course to be publicly available, you should press the 'Edit' button at the top of the course screen. Then, select the **Public** radio button in the Visibility section.

##How to Use and Modify a public course
If you do not have a paid organization account, you will not be using the classes features. To both use and modify a public course you should do the following

- Locate and select the Course you are interested in
- Click on the project name in the **source** column to open the project in the IDE
- You should now **fork** this project from the 'Project->Fork' menu item
- You will now have a copy of the project/module in your own account listing
- You can now use the project as a *student* or you can use/modify it for your own courses if you're a *teacher*

##Important
When you assign a Codio course to the public domain, you should be prepared for this course to be used and modified freely and without restriction.
