A Guide is a way of providing tutorial content to the student. Codio Guides will allow you to write rich, multi-page content using simple markdown.

The general idea is that the student sees the content in one Codio IDE pane and can navigate between instruction steps. Meanwhile, another pane(s) is used to write your code.
