When you create a course, ownership and administrative rights are automatically assigned to you. However, you may also wish to assign administration permissions to other users.

To do this, you should select your course and press the 'Edit' button in the top course section. You can then press the 'Permissions' button to add or remove admin users. Start typing the user's full name or Codio user name and matches will appear automatically below.

Once you have added users, they will appear below the search field
