Each class has at least one teacher. Teachers can 

- modify class properties
- delete the class
- access student code from the class listing
- assign grades and comments to each student module assignment

![](docs/education/class-teachers.png)

When you create a new class, the user who created it will automatically be assigned teacher status. To add further teachers to the class, select the Teachers menu item.

You can now add Teachers by searching for Codio users using their full name or their Codio user name.

Teachers are only able to 

- assign modules to classes
- view student code from the class modules list
- grade and comment
