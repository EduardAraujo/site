If you are a student looking to use Codio courses then there are two main features Codio offers.

- Classes as a part of an organization
- Public courses created by other Codio users

If you are being taught as a part of a class, your teachers will probably have an organization account and will set up a class for you. If not, then you can still find and use public courses.


##Classes
If you are part of an educational organization then a teacher will create a class and within that class will be a series of modules. The class list looks something like this 

Click on the Classes menu item beneath the Education menu item in the left pane in your Codio dashboard. This will show you a list of classes to which you have been assigned by a teacher.

Select a class by clicking on the class name and you will see a list of all the modules in the course. 

Even though you can see all modules available for the course, you can only access the modules that have been specifically assigned by your teacher at that point in time. Assigned modules can be identified by the appearance of the 'Open in IDE' icon in the right most column.

When you see this icon, you can click on it and your project assignment will be loaded. You will be shown instructions on how to proceed within the project itself.

###Getting back to the Dashboard
To return to your dashboard, click on your user name in the top right of the screen or use the Project->Exit menu item.


##Public Courses
Free users, subscribers and organization subscribers can all look for public courses created by other Codio users.

From the main Codio dashboard, select the Education menu item on the left pane. Beneath this you will then see a 'Courses' menu item. Click on this to see all available courses. You can use the search box to search for project names or text in the description fields.

We will be soon be providing additional categorization options so that content authors can assign their courses to categories such as Programming Language, Skill Level, Content Type. 

When you find a course that you want to try out, you should click on it and then click on any of the modules within the course. This will open up the module as a normal Codio project.

Once it is open, you should fork the project into your own account from the 'Project->Fork' menu item.
