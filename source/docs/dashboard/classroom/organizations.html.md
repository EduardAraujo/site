##Free usage
You do not need any form of paid account to create courses and modules. Other users will be able to find these and then fork your modules as required.

##Paid usage
If you want to use Codio to teach classes of students then you will need a paid organization account (while Codio Education remains in Beta, we are allowing usage of the classes features with the Free organization account). 

Codio offers significant discounts on organization accounts for not-for-profit educational institutions. 

If you just want to keep your course modules **private**, then you have the following options

- a regular Codio subscription if you are working alone
- an organizational subscription if you plan to use classes or if you want to develop private course content with others under one umbrella account

##Creating an Organization
Organizations can be found in the main menu bar on the left side of your dashboard screen. To create a new organization

- select 'Organizations' in the main menu bar in the left pane
- press the 'Create' button in the Organizations menu column
- enter a name for your organization
- select a plan (during the beta phase, classes can be used with a Free organization account)
- press the 'Next' button 
- if you selected a Paid organization plan then you will be taken to the payment screen
- finally, you can add additional 'owners' for your Organization
- press 'Finish'' to create your organization

You can read more about organizations [here](/docs/dashboard/organizations).

##Owners and Class creation rights
Only organization owners can currently create classes. If you created your organizational account then you will automatically be an organization owner and can therefore create classes. If you want other people to be able to do so, then you should go to the Teams option within your organization and add them to the Owners team.

##All Members team
If you want to see a complete list of all people within your organization then you should select the Teams menu item and then click on the All Members team.

When you add students to classes, they will automatically be added to your organization and will appear within the All Members team.
