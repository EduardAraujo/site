The Classrooms menu item can be found in the left side of the Codio dashboard.

To access Classrooms, you will need to have an [Organization](/docs/dashboard/organizations/) account. [Click here](/docs/quickstart/education) for information about a full-featured free trial including private Projects, Stacks, Starter Packs and Tutorials.

Classrooms can only be created by members of the Owners team. Teams are managed in the [Organization](/docs/dashboard/organizations/) section.

- A class is a collection of students (Codio users).
- A class is associated with a Tutorial. 
- You can assign modules from within the associated Tutorial to the class.

##Classroom Listings
The main Classrooms screen shows a complete listing of all Classrooms belonging to any organizations you are a member of.

When you select a Classroom, you are immediately shown the Tutorial that has been assigned to that Classroom as well as the complete list of modules that make up that Tutorial.

You can then select a module and you will see a list of all students who are in the class and were assigned that module.

From the list of students for the module, you are also able to access an individual student's code when they have completed the module (circled in the screenshot below).

You can even assign a grade to the student's work and add comments when they have completed the module (circled in the screenshot below).

You can also add Teachers to the class so more than one teacher can view and grade student code.
