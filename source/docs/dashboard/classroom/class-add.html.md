To add a new Classroom, press the 'Create' button from the main classes screen. You will then be asked to provide further details. Only the Classroom name is required 
On creation, you will be automatically added as a Teacher for that class. Teachers are able to assign modules to the Classroom, view student code and assign grades and comments.

##Name & Description
You are required to enter a **Name** for your class. The **Description** is optional but we strongly recommend providing a detailed description to help students find the correct class and to clearly differentiate from others. 

##Organization
If you only belong to one Organization then this will be pre-populated. If you belong to more than one Organization then be careful to select the appropriate one.

##Begin & End Dates
These are purely for display purposes and are optional.

##Tutorial
You can at this point assign a Tutorial to the class. Press the ellipsis to choose a Tutorial.
