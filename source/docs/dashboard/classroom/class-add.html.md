To add a new class, press the 'Create' button from the main classes screen. You will then be asked to provide further details. Only the class name is mandatory. 

When you create a class, you will be automatically added as a Teacher for that class. Teachers are able to assign modules to the class, view student code and assign grades and comments.

- You are required to enter a **Name** for your class. The **Description** is optional.
- The **Owner** field is important to understand. You should select the organization from the dropdown that this class belongs to. This ensures that it will appear in the class list as belonging to that organization.
- **Begin and End Dates** are optional and are used for reporting/filtering purposes only.
- **Permissions** allows you to assign administration rights to other Codio users for this class. Start typing the user's full name or Codio user name and matches will appear automatically below. You can also assign permissions after the class has been created.
