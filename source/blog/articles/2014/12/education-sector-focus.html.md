Today marks an important milestone for Codio as we announce our commitment to the education sector.

## Education Sector Focus

From the outset, Codio was founded with a mission to help teach the world to code. We’ve been inspired by the capacity of teachers and students alike to both impart and develop knowledge & skills in so many new ways with computer programming.

We’ve also seen the transformational impact of technology on the teaching and learning experience, unlocking new potential for teachers to coach and mentor, and new opportunities for students to learn independently or in self-organised groups.

So today we’re proud to announce that Codio’s core focus will be on the education sector, with products and services increasingly tailored to teaching computer programming in schools and universities.

We’ll continue to support all developers – themselves lifelong learners – but Codio is now an education technology company.

## Commitment to Innovation

We passionately believe it’s possible to create a teaching and learning experience that reflects a professional grade IDE with a user experience that inspires innovation in education.

We were thrilled to find out recently that our focus on innovation is gaining recognition – with Codio now shortlisted as a finalist for “Innovator of the Year” at the 2015 BETT awards. Take a look at the video below to see our story:
