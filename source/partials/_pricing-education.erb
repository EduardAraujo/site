    <aside>Whole School & University Licences</aside>
    <article>
      Codio offers flexible school and university licences priced at a substantial discount
      to the enterprise sector. We recognise the breadth of institution funding
      arrangements - you can licence annually or achieve even better value for money with a
      three year plan.
      </p>
      <p>
      Whole institution licence pricing is based on the size of the student user group - generally within
      an acceptable range for computer science and related subject department budgets when compared
      with typical course material expenditure per student.
